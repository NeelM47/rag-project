## Work Experience

### Senior Software Engineer - Nova Dynamics (2022 - Present)

At Nova Dynamics, a leader in logistics and supply chain optimization, Neel was instrumental in developing their next-generation predictive analytics platform, "Project Foresight."

As a senior member of the team, he led the architecture and development of a machine learning pipeline that forecasted shipping delays with 92% accuracy. This involved processing terabytes of historical shipping data, weather patterns, and global logistics events. He designed a scalable microservices architecture using Python, FastAPI, and RabbitMQ for asynchronous task handling. The data was stored and queried from a high-performance PostgreSQL database, which he helped design and optimize. A significant achievement was reducing model inference time by 40% through strategic caching with Redis. He also mentored junior engineers, championing Test-Driven Development (TDD) and clean code principles.

### Software Engineer - Crestview Solutions (2019 - 2022)

Neel began his career at Crestview Solutions, a company focused on creating SaaS products for small businesses. He was a full-stack developer on their flagship product, an all-in-one marketing and CRM platform.

During his time there, he worked extensively with a Django monolith, where he was responsible for both building new features and maintaining existing ones. He successfully led a project to refactor the application's authentication system to use modern OAuth2 protocols, improving security and user experience. On the front-end, he utilized JavaScript and a bit of React to build interactive data visualization dashboards for customers. He gained foundational experience deploying applications to the cloud using Docker containers on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), specifically with Cloud Run and Cloud SQL.

## Passion Projects

Neel believes that personal projects are the best way to learn and stay creative.

### Project: "Chroma-Flow" - AI-Powered Playlist Generator

Frustrated with generic music recommendations, Neel built Chroma-Flow, a web application that generates playlists based on mood, genre, and even color palettes from an uploaded image.

He developed a custom algorithm that maps audio features (like tempo, valence, and energy) from the Spotify API to emotional and visual data. The back-end is a Flask application that communicates with a machine learning model he trained to classify song moods. The most challenging part was the data pipeline, which involved fetching and processing data for thousands of tracks. This project solidified his skills in working with third-party APIs, building data models, and deploying a complete web application from scratch.

### Project: "Home-Hive" - Smart Home IoT Hub

An avid tinkerer, Neel created a custom smart home hub using a Raspberry Pi. This project, "Home-Hive," integrates various smart devices (lights, sensors, smart plugs) from different manufacturers into a single, unified interface. The software is written entirely in Python and uses the MQTT protocol for lightweight device communication. He built a simple, mobile-friendly web dashboard with Flask to control everything in his home, showcasing his skills in IoT, networking, and hardware-software integration.

## Hobbies & Interests

When he's not coding, Neel is passionate about exploring the world in both digital and physical forms. He is an avid landscape photographer, often taking long weekend trips to national parks to capture the perfect sunrise. He finds that the patience and composition required in photography offer a refreshing contrast to the logical world of software development.

He is also a dedicated home cook, specializing in regional Indian cuisine. He enjoys the process of deconstructing complex recipes and understanding the chemistry behind cooking. He maintains a personal blog where he documents his culinary experiments, complete with his own food photography. This hobby combines his love for creativity, precision, and sharing his creations with others.
